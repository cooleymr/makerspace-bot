# makerspace-bot
My senior capstone project for the Spring 2024 semester

**How to install:**

1. Download script
2. Replace BOT_TOKEN with new Bot Token (Found here: https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
3. Replace STUDENT_CHANNEL_ID and TA_CHANNEL_ID with proper channel ID's (Go into Developer mode, right click on desired channels, click 'Copy Channel ID')
4. Run Script

   
**OPTIONAL**
- For 24/7 running **without** interruption, run script on SSH server **with** screen command
- See *upload info file, for information on SSH upload procedure, screen commands, and general usage commands
- Put script in folder so the created 'print_jobs.csv' file is automatically created in same folder
